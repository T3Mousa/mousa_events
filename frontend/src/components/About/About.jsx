                <p>I&apos;m Amanda Mousa Gazaleh, proud owner of Mousa Events, a well-established event planning company based in Northeast Florida. With 15 years of experience, I take pride in planning various events, not just limited to weddings. My journey began when I graduated from the University of Florida in 2007. Initially, my career ambition was to become a sports broadcaster, but after an internship with a local TV news station, I shifted my focus to event planning. I gained valuable experience in the field of communications while working at a marketing agency in Downtown Jacksonville, eventually leading me to follow my passion and establish Mousa Events.</p>

                <p>I have a profound love for Jacksonville and am intimately familiar with the city. I adore the sunny weather, enjoy the beach and pool, and am a bit obsessed with Mexican cuisine. Additionally, I&apos;m always up for a fun night of dancing and socializing. Family is a top priority for me, and I am blessed with a wonderful husband, Phillip, and two lively boys, Buddy and Victor.</p>

                <p>One question I&apos;m often asked is, &quot;Why should I choose you as our event planner?&quot; The answer is simple: love. I am deeply passionate about what I do and look forward to building meaningful relationships with each client. I truly love my clients, my work and making life&apos;s most special moments come to life brings me immense joy. Let&apos;s work together to create something amazing!</p>

                <p>Thank you for visiting our website, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
